                        <p>Everyday about 333 billion emails are sent everyday and this contributes to about 81.3 billion grams of CO2 emissions. 
                            Research shows that about 84.8% of emails are spam and/or not important. 
                            These emails can be easily avoided by users which inturn will decrease the carbon footprint of emails.

                        emails everyday. Between students and teachers, so much communication is done
                        through email, which is highly related to the topic. Moreover, they are the people who
                        are easily contacted.</p>

                            emitted by an individual, what are the main sources, and what people's habits are in
                            operating email. In addition, we want to find current solutions and gaps in this problem.</p>

                    <h5>Insights and analysis</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users mainly use smartphones and laptops to check email, with an average of 43% for
                        smartphones and 41% for laptops.</li>
                        <li>In terms of deleting emails and organizing mailboxes, the percentage of users who
                        primarily use smartphones and computers is 45.7% for both. 8.6% used both devices to
                        manage their mailboxes with similar frequency. No one uses a tablet to organize
                        mailboxes.</li>
                        <li>The main factors that determine whether a user wants to delete an email or not are the
                        time and effort required to do so. Interestingly, six users filled in other options, saying
                        annoying reminders, red dots, and convenient gesture interactions on their phones as
                        stronger drivers.</li>
                        <li>22.9% of users always delete emails. 42.9% of users delete emails sometimes, and
                        25.7% of users rarely or never delete emails.</li>
                        <li>The main reasons why people are reluctant to delete emails are the time (34.3%) and
                        hassle (31.4%) involved in doing so.</li>

                        <p>We asked four users to use our application and review it. Being involved deeply in the carbon footprint of an email we were more aware of the impact of an email. We wanted users to review our prototypes to get feedback on what features they liked or they wanted to see in their email service providers

                    <p style="padding:35px;">Coming from a technology background. I worked on multiple work items during my professional experience, I never thought about the amount of effort, research, and the different techniques which are used to gather requirements. This course was intellectually stimulating as I was able to understand the thought and process which goes behind designing a solution for a problem that is very broad.
                        As an engineer, it was hard for me to stop thinking of a solution during the research phase but I overcame this and was solely able to focus on describing a problem we face in our lives. Some of the requirements we gathered from qualitative research were truly amazing because as daily users we don't realize what we need until we observe ourselves.
                        During the brainstorming sessions with my teammates, I was able to understand the perspective of people who belong to different backgrounds trying to solve the same question. This made me realize the differences we had in a good way as we used them as a strength and built upon each other's ideas.
                        These were some of the most useful techniques which I plan to use in any project I will be part of in the future.

                <p>This project would not have been possible without the help of my amazing teammates. We were able to collaborate and build on each other's ideas. We were mindful of our backgrounds and helped each other where ever required.</p>
